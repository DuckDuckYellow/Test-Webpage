As the final whistle blew on our last game of the season, I stood on the touchline in disbelief. Forty-two games, countless training sessions, and more tactical adjustments than I could count had led to this moment. We had finished second in the league, securing automatic promotion to League Two. Wrexham AFC was going up.

The journey to get here had been nothing short of remarkable. After that opening defeat to Grimsby, we went on an incredible unbeaten run of seventeen games. The players had completely bought into the system, and watching them execute the game plan week after week was a joy. Our home form was particularly impressive - the Racecourse Ground had become a fortress.

Marcus Williams, our captain, had been outstanding. His leadership on and off the pitch was invaluable, and his eight goals from midfield were crucial in tight games. He embodied everything I wanted this team to be: hardworking, intelligent, and never giving up. When he lifted the runners-up trophy, I felt immense pride.

The signing of Danny Robertson in January proved to be a masterstroke. He arrived on loan from a Championship club, initially skeptical about dropping down to the National League. But within weeks, he was our most important player. His creativity in the final third unlocked defenses that had frustrated us all season. Twelve assists in twenty games speaks for itself.

Not everything went smoothly, of course. We hit a rough patch in February, going four games without a win. The pressure mounted, and I could see doubt creeping into some players' faces. It was in those moments that I learned the most about management. It's easy to lead when things are going well; the true test is how you respond to adversity.

I called a team meeting after our third consecutive draw. No tactics, no video analysis. Just an honest conversation about what we were trying to achieve. The players opened up about their fears, their frustrations, and their hopes. That meeting changed everything. We won our next six games and never looked back.

Looking ahead to League Two, I know the challenges will be different. The quality of opposition will be higher, and the physical demands will increase. But I've never been more confident in this group of players. We've proven that we can compete, that we can overcome obstacles, and that we belong among the best. Season one is complete. The real work starts now.
