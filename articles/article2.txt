Five new starters in the first XI. Four under 21. One 33-year-old captain who'd never met them before.
This was never going to be easy.
Team cohesion takes time - usually 15-20 games before players understand each other's movement, anticipate decisions, cover mistakes. Newton didn't have 15-20 games. The board expected playoffs. The fans expected miracles. And the squad? They barely knew each other's names.
The warning signs were there: dressing room cliques forming, uncertain body language in training, players unsure of their roles. This squad needed time to gel - time Newton didn't have.


Pre-season revealed the system's strengths and weaknesses quickly. Against Leamington and Maidstone, the 4-4-2 dominated possession but struggled to convert chances. Against Mansfield and Stockport (League One and Two), the lack of cohesion showed - defensive errors, midfield gaps, strikers isolated.
The message was clear: if they didn't gel fast, National League defenders would expose them.
We went into August with results that seemed promising, with 6 games in the National League the Morecambe team won 3, drew 2 and lost 1 sitting 3rd in the table behind Carlisle and Rochdale.

Muskwe, playing as a poacher, was the early top scorer. But Buabo - the 6’2" target forward on loan from Ipswich - struggled to find his feet. Isolated, starved of service, still adjusting to the pace. At wing-back though, Dixon was electric - overlapping runs, dangerous crosses, already creating chances.

Then something clicked. Game by game, the partnerships strengthened. MacDonald and Avenell learned each other's positioning. Dixon timed his overlaps perfectly. And most importantly, Buabo and Muskwe developed telepathy. 

The statement arrived on November 1st. Peterborough, a League One side, arrived at the Mazuma Mobile Stadium expecting a routine cup tie. They left shell-shocked. 6-3. Buabo scored a hat-trick. Muskwe bagged two. Even Francillette, a centre-back, got on the scoresheet.
“They're not just a National League team,” Peterborough's manager muttered afterwards. “They're League Two quality already.”



Remember when I said Buabo wasn’t scoring? 

After 15 games, Buabo had 10 goals and was consistently man of the match material. Muskwe was even better - 14 goals and 6 assists in 19 games.
But Newton was focused elsewhere, locked in his office, eyes fixed on the league table. Carlisle sat one point ahead after winning 12 of their first 16 games with a huge xG overperformance of +13 points - they were winning games they statistically should've drawn or lost. Surely their luck had to run out?

Dixon was outstanding from wing-back - 1 goal and 7 assists, consistently Morecambe's most creative outlet. Azeez, our deep-lying playmaker, dictated tempo from midfield with 2 goals and 1 assist. Aarons cut inside brilliantly for 4 goals and 7 assists. And MacDonald? The captain simply organized, led, defended.



As the clock struck midnight into 2026, Morecambe sat top of the National League. 65 points from 25 games. Carlisle, the early pace-setters, had dropped to 2nd after their xG bubble burst.
In the dressing room, Muskwe celebrated his 25th goal of the season. Buabo finally found his feet with 10 goals. MacDonald's leadership had transformed the defence.
But 21 games remained. And in the National League, nothing is guaranteed.
The rescue mission was only half complete.
