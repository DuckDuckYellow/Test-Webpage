Champions of the National League. 107 points. Automatic promotion secured.
But there was a problem: half the squad was leaving.
Avenell, the 19-year-old centre-back? Returning to Brentford. Dixon, the electric wing-back? Everton wanted him back. Rak-Sakyi? Chelsea recalled him. Buabo, due to return on loan to Ipswich. Newton needed replacements. Fast. Cheap. Ready for League Two.
First came the hard part.
Eleven players. Eleven conversations. Eleven disappointed faces.
Newton sat in his office as, one by one, they filed in. Some argued. Some nodded quietly. One cried. All of them had helped win the National League title. All of them were being released.
'You're good enough for the National League,' Newton told each of them. 'But League Two is a different animal. I need experience, physicality, and players who've done this before.'
It was brutal. It was necessary.

Harry Cornick arrived first. Thirty-one years old, 371 Championship appearances, and legs that wouldn't last forever. Free transfer from Bristol City. Work Rate 16, Stamina 16 - he'd run until his body gave out.
"How much football do you have left?" Newton asked.
"One season," Cornick replied. "Maybe two."
"One season is all I need."
Next came the centre-back shopping. Rhys Williams, the 6'5" Liverpool defender who'd been on loan at Morecambe in 2024, was available. Perfect fit. One problem: he wanted £3,500 per week more than double Morecambe’s current highest paid player.
Newton offered £2,000 flat.
Williams' agent scoffed: "He played for Liverpool."
Three days later, Williams signed for £2,000 per week. £78,000 per year saved.


Newton did his homework. Eighteen Premier League U21 players released in the summer - all talented, all available, all free. He assessed them all. Watched footage. Ran trials. Checked stats.
Strikers? Too small. Midfielders? Too soft. Veterans? Too slow.
Result: Rejected fifteen of them.
Only three made the cut: striker Leon Myrtaj from Tottenham (pace and finishing), defender Tate Ferdinand from Brighton (physicality), and centre back Alex Faux from Fulham (work rate). All 18 years old. All hungry. All cheap at £310 per week.
'Premier League academies produce technical players,' Newton muttered. 'I need fighters.’

Two decisions defined the summer.
First: Make Buabo permanent. The 20-year-old target forward had scored 28 goals on loan from Ipswich. The Buabo-Muskwe partnership was devastating - 66 goals between them, 62% of Morecambe's output. Could it work in League Two?
Newton paid £24,000 to find out.
Second: Keep Dixon. The electric wing-back on loan from Everton had been Morecambe's best player - 1 goal, 7 assists, consistently the highest-rated performer. Everton agreed to another season-long loan.
The strike partnership was staying. The creativity was staying. The spine of the championship-winning team remained intact.

And yes, Newton signed another Williams. Dylan Williams, left wing-back on a season long loan from Burton. That made it three: Rhys Williams (CB), Ben Williams (LWB backup), and Dylan Williams (LWB).
'I'm banning the name Williams from future signings,' Newton told his scouts. 'This is getting ridiculous.'

With Rak-Sayki not interested in returning to Morecambe for a second season (despite Newton phoning him personally to offer him a contract to play). Urgent reinforcements were needed at Defensive Midfielder after making the call that our backup wasn’t good enough for the pressure of League 2. What do we want in this position? We want someone who is massive, strong and attacking midfielders see in their dreams the night after a game. Newton put the call out on social media, “anyone strong, fit and over 6’ can have a trial in Morecambe in July.” When the dust settled he had 28 man-mountains stood before him on the training pitch. 
The tests for these players during the 2 weeks were ‘unconventional’, some would say that the Geneva Convention on cruel and unusual punishment on football was violated during the period but at the end of it, Newton had his two picks.
Franklin Wadja, 31, from Cameroon via French lower leagues. Strength 13, Bravery 15, Natural Fitness 14. Not the most technical, but tough as nails and fit enough to play 46 games.
Raphaël Ndong, 25, from Senegal. 6'2", Aggression 14, Tackling 14. Could play centre-back OR defensive midfield - the hybrid option Newton craved.
Before July, neither could find Morecambe on a map. After two weeks on that training pitch, they'd earned their contracts.

Roque Santa Cruz. The name alone carried weight.
Born in Asunción, Paraguay. 111 international caps, 32 goals for his country. Bundesliga champion with Bayern Munich. Premier League striker for Manchester City and Blackburn Rovers. 674 career appearances. 185 goals.
At 44 years old, most players would be coaching. Santa Cruz wanted one more season.
There was one problem: he wanted £3,000 per week.
Newton's current highest earner was Rhys Williams at £2,000 per week. Paying a 44-year-old backup striker £3,000 per week would blow the wage structure apart.
Newton called Santa Cruz's agent. "I can offer £800 per week."
The agent laughed. "He's played in World Cups. He's won the Bundesliga. He's—"
"He's 44," Newton interrupted. "And I'm offering him football. One last season. League Two might not be the Allianz Arena, but it's better than retirement."
Silence.
Four days later, Santa Cruz signed for £800 per week.
Newton hung up the phone and smiled. Either he'd just signed a 44-year-old legend who'd inspire the squad and mentor the youngsters, or he'd wasted £40,000 on a publicity stunt.
Time would tell.
By August 1st, the rebuild was complete.
Total spend: £24,000 in transfer fees (Buabo). New wages: ~£7,000 per week across all signings.
Key signings:
Rhys Williams (£2k/w) 
Buabo (£1.7k/w) 
Cornick (£1.1k/w) 
Santa Cruz (£800/w) 
Wadja, Ndong (£1k/w total)
Three youth prospects (£310/w each) 
Average squad age: 27.8 years old - one of the oldest in League Two.
The message boards erupted: "Newton's built a retirement home!"
The board was nervous. "You're signing pensioners," the chairman said, only half-joking.
Newton shrugged. "I'm signing winners. Experience beats potential when you're trying to survive."
League Two kicked off on August 1st, 2026. Morecambe, the newly-promoted champions, faced Salford at home.
The board's target? Avoid relegation.
Newton's target? Prove the 4-4-2 worked at a higher level.
And Santa Cruz? He just wanted to score goals.
