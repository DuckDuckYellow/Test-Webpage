There are certain matches that transcend the usual three points. Games where history, passion, and local pride collide to create something unforgettable. Our Welsh derby against Newport County was exactly that kind of fixture.

The build-up had been intense. Both clubs were fighting for promotion, separated by just two points in the table. Social media was ablaze with fans from both sides predicting victory. My inbox was flooded with interview requests. The local press couldn't get enough of the rivalry narrative.

I tried to shield the players from the noise, but it was impossible. This wasn't just another game, and pretending otherwise would have been naive. Instead, I embraced the occasion. I showed them clips of historic Welsh derbies, talked about what it means to the supporters, and challenged them to write their own chapter in this story.

Match day arrived cold and wet - proper football weather. The Racecourse Ground was packed to capacity, the atmosphere electric before kick-off. I could see the nervous energy in my players' eyes during the warm-up. Good. That meant they cared.

The first half was a cagey affair. Both teams were clearly desperate not to make a mistake, and chances were few. Newport had the better of the possession, but we looked dangerous on the counter. Half-time came with the score goalless, and I reminded the players that this game would be won by whoever showed more courage.

The second half exploded into life within minutes. Jake Thompson latched onto a long ball over the top and finished coolly past the goalkeeper. The stadium erupted. We were ahead in the Welsh derby. The feeling was indescribable.

But Newport are a good side, and they responded well. For twenty minutes, they pinned us back, searching for an equalizer. David Okonkwo was magnificent, clearing everything that came into our box. When he headed away a certain goal from a corner kick, I genuinely thought we might hold on.

Then disaster struck. A soft foul on the edge of our area, and Newport's set-piece specialist stepped up. Time seemed to slow as the ball curled over the wall and nestled in the bottom corner. 1-1 with fifteen minutes remaining.

The stadium fell silent for a moment, then rose again. The fans knew we weren't beaten yet. I made attacking substitutions, throwing caution to the wind. This was a game we had to win.

In the eighty-ninth minute, Miguel Santos picked up the ball thirty yards from goal. He had been quiet all game, but class always finds a way. He shifted onto his right foot and unleashed a shot that flew into the top corner. The goalkeeper didn't move. Neither did I, for several seconds. Then the realization hit - we had done it.

The final whistle brought scenes of pure joy. Players collapsed to the ground, fans streamed onto the pitch, and I just stood there trying to take it all in. This was why I got into football. These moments, these memories, this connection between a club and its community. The Welsh derby was ours.
