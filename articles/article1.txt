It was a cold January morning when I first walked through the doors of the Racecourse Ground. Wrexham AFC, a club steeped in history, was about to become my responsibility. The board had just sacked the previous manager after a string of poor results, and here I was, a complete unknown, ready to take on the challenge of a lifetime.

The squad I inherited was a mixed bag. There were some experienced heads who knew the league inside out, and a handful of young players with potential waiting to be unlocked. My first task was simple: assess what we had and figure out how to get results quickly. The fans were restless, and I needed to win them over.

My first training session was an eye-opener. The fitness levels were all over the place, and the tactical understanding was basic at best. The previous manager had clearly favored a direct style of play, but I had other ideas. I believe in possession football, in controlling games, in making the opposition chase shadows. It would take time, but I was confident we could transform this team.

The staff were welcoming enough, though I could sense some skepticism. Who was this new guy coming in with his fancy ideas? I made sure to listen more than I talked in those early days. Understanding the culture of a club is just as important as understanding the players. Wrexham is a community club, deeply connected to its supporters, and I needed to respect that history while building something new.

My first match in charge was away to Grimsby Town. The pressure was immense. I barely slept the night before, running through every possible scenario in my head. When the whistle blew, I felt a strange calm wash over me. This was it. This was what I had always dreamed of.

We lost 2-1. A late goal that felt like a punch to the gut. But I saw glimpses of what we could become. The players were buying into the system, even if the results weren't there yet. Football is a game of fine margins, and I knew that with a few adjustments, we could turn those losses into wins.

Walking off the pitch that day, I made a promise to myself and to the fans watching from the away end. We would get better. We would fight for every point. And one day, we would bring glory back to Wrexham AFC. The journey had only just begun.
