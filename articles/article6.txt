Ninety minutes stood between us and the League Two title. The final game of the season, at home, against a mid-table side with nothing to play for. Win, and we were champions. Anything else, and we would have to hope our rivals slipped up. I couldn't sleep the night before.

The morning of the match felt surreal. I went through my usual pre-game routine - coffee, toast, reviewing the tactical plan one final time - but nothing felt normal. My hands trembled slightly as I knotted my tie. After everything we had been through over the past two seasons, it came down to this.

The team bus arrived at the Racecourse Ground to scenes I had never witnessed before. Thousands of fans lined the streets, waving flags and singing songs. Some had tears in their eyes before a ball had even been kicked. This wasn't just a football match; it was a celebration of community, belonging, and shared dreams.

In the dressing room, I kept my team talk short. We had prepared all week. We knew what we needed to do. I looked at each player individually - veterans who had been with me from the start, new signings who had exceeded expectations, academy graduates living their dream. This was their moment.

The game began at a frantic pace. The crowd was deafening, willing us forward with every attack. But our opponents were organized and compact, happy to frustrate us. Half-time arrived with the score goalless, and I could sense anxiety spreading through the stands.

I made a tactical adjustment, pushing Ryan Matthews higher up the pitch to overload the midfield. It worked almost immediately. Within five minutes of the restart, we won a corner. Miguel Santos swung it in, and Marcus Williams rose highest to power a header into the net. The stadium exploded. 1-0.

But football never makes things easy. Just fifteen minutes later, a defensive error allowed their striker a clear run on goal. He finished expertly, and suddenly it was 1-1. News filtered through that our rivals were winning. We needed another goal, or the title would slip away.

The next twenty minutes were among the most stressful of my life. We threw everything forward, creating chance after chance, but the ball just wouldn't go in. Their goalkeeper was having the game of his life, producing save after save. I began to accept that it might not be our day.

Then, in the eighty-seventh minute, Jake Thompson received the ball with his back to goal. He turned his marker beautifully and drove toward the penalty area. A defender lunged in desperately and caught his ankle. Penalty.

The stadium fell silent. Thompson himself picked up the ball, placed it on the spot, and waited. I couldn't watch. I turned away, staring at the ground, listening for the reaction that would tell me everything.

The roar that followed was unlike anything I had ever heard. Thompson had scored. 2-1. We were three minutes away from glory.

Those final minutes lasted an eternity. Every clearance felt like a goal, every opposition attack like a mortal threat. But we held on. When the referee finally blew his whistle, I fell to my knees. Champions. League Two champions. Wrexham AFC, going up again.

What followed was a blur of joy, tears, and celebrations. The trophy lift, the lap of honor, the faces of fans who had waited decades for this moment. I thought about everyone who had made this possible - the players, the staff, the board, the supporters. This was their achievement as much as mine.

Tonight, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we start planning for League One. The journey continues, and I cannot wait to see where it takes us next.
