When I first arrived at Wrexham, the youth academy was an afterthought. Underfunded, understaffed, and largely ignored by the previous management. That needed to change. I firmly believe that a club's long-term success depends on its ability to develop homegrown talent.

Working with the board, we invested in new training facilities for the youth teams. We hired additional coaches with experience in player development. We established a clear pathway from the academy to the first team, so young players could see a realistic route to professional football.

The results have exceeded my expectations. This season alone, three academy graduates have made their first-team debuts. Each of them brings something different, but they all share the same hunger to succeed.

Ryan Matthews was the first to break through. A central midfielder with an engine that never stops, he made his debut in a cup game and immediately looked at home. His reading of the game belies his eighteen years, and his passing range is already better than several of our senior players. He's started the last ten league games and hasn't looked back.

Ethan Jones came through slightly later but has made an equally impressive impact. A left-back with pace to burn and a wand of a left foot, he offers something different from our other options. His delivery from wide areas has created multiple goals, and his defensive positioning improves with every game. At nineteen, he has a huge future ahead of him.

The most exciting prospect, however, might be sixteen-year-old Sophie Williams from our newly formed women's pathway program. While she's not eligible for the men's first team, her performances for the U-18s caught the attention of several Women's Super League clubs. We're working with the Welsh FA to ensure she gets the best possible development opportunities. She represents exactly what we're trying to build - a club that nurtures talent regardless of where it comes from.

Developing young players requires patience. There will be setbacks, mistakes, and moments of doubt. But I would rather give opportunities to hungry youngsters than rely solely on experienced players approaching the end of their careers. The academy graduates bring energy, enthusiasm, and a genuine love for the club that money simply cannot buy.

The senior players have embraced their role as mentors. Marcus Williams in particular has taken Ryan under his wing, spending extra time after training to work on his positioning. Seeing that kind of relationship develop reinforces my belief that we're building something special here.

Looking at next season's academy intake, there are several more players who could make the step up. The pipeline is flowing, and the culture of development is becoming embedded in everything we do. Wrexham AFC will always invest in its future. These young players are that future, and I couldn't be more proud of their progress.
