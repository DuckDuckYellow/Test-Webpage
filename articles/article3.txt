The transfer window is always a stressful time for a manager. You have a vision of how you want your squad to look, but the reality of budgets, player preferences, and competing clubs often gets in the way. This summer was particularly challenging as we prepared for life in League Two.

My priority was clear: we needed more quality in depth. Last season, our starting eleven could compete with anyone, but injuries and suspensions exposed our lack of options. The board had given me a modest budget - nothing extravagant, but enough to make a difference if spent wisely.

My first target was a goalscorer. We had created plenty of chances last season but too often failed to convert them. I had my eye on Jake Thompson, a young striker languishing in the reserves of a Premier League club. He had pace, movement, and an eye for goal. After two weeks of negotiations, we finally got the deal done. A season-long loan with an option to buy - exactly what we needed.

The midfield was next on my list. Danny Robertson's loan had ended, and he returned to his parent club. Replacing his creativity was essential. We signed Miguel Santos, a Portuguese playmaker with experience in the lower leagues of Spain. His technique was sublime, and at twenty-four, he still had room to improve. The language barrier was initially a concern, but football is universal, and he settled in quickly.

Defense was where we struggled most in negotiations. Every center-back I wanted was either too expensive or not interested in joining a newly promoted club. Deadline day arrived, and we were still short at the back. At 10 PM, my phone rang. An agent I had worked with before had a player available - David Okonkwo, a Nigerian international who had fallen out with his club in Belgium. We had four hours to complete the deal.

What followed was the most intense few hours of my managerial career. Medical examinations, contract negotiations, international clearance - everything had to be done at breakneck speed. At 11:47 PM, with just thirteen minutes to spare, we submitted the paperwork. David was a Wrexham player.

Looking at the squad now, I'm pleased with what we've assembled. We've added quality without losing the team spirit that served us so well last season. The new signings have all shown the right attitude in pre-season, and competition for places is fierce. That's exactly what I want - players pushing each other to improve every single day.

Some fans have questioned whether we've done enough. That's fair. Expectations are high after last season's success, and I understand the desire for marquee signings. But I believe in building sustainably, in finding value where others don't look, and in developing players rather than just buying finished products. Time will tell if this approach works at a higher level.
