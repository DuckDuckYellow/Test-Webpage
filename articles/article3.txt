January belonged to Morecambe.
Six wins and one draw from seven games. The 4-4-2 was purring. Buabo and Muskwe were unstoppable. Every week, opposition managers tried something different - sitting deep, pressing high, man-marking the strikers - and every week, Morecambe found a way through.
By the end of January, the lead had stretched. Carlisle were still there, clinging on with their statistical luck. But Morecambe were pulling away.
Behind the scenes, Newton continued trimming the squad. Scales and Sesay - fringe players with a combined 5 appearances - were sold for £340 and £1,500/week in wages saved. Every penny mattered for what lay ahead.

Then February hit.
FA Trophy, Quarter-Final. Carlisle away. A chance for revenge, a trophy run, momentum. Morecambe lost 2-1. Sloppy defending. Missed chances. The first real wobble.
Worse followed. Three league games without a win - two draws, one loss. The lead narrowed. Carlisle, somehow, kept winning games they shouldn't. Their xG overperformance had ballooned to +16 points. Sixteen! They were defying every statistical model in existence.
The message boards lit up: 'We're bottling it. Classic Morecambe.'
Even the board wavered. In a tense meeting, they told Newton: 'Playoffs will do us just fine, you know.'
Newton didn't agree.
The response was immediate. Five straight wins. 15 points from 15.
Muskwe scored in three consecutive games. Buabo returned from a month long injury and bagged a brace against Aldershot Town. The defence, marshalled by MacDonald, kept three clean sheets. Dixon and Williams bombed forward relentlessly.
By mid-April, Morecambe needed just one win from their final four games. And fate had arranged the perfect stage: Carlisle at home.
The Mazuma Mobile Stadium was rocking. 6,241 fans - a sell-out. Carlisle, the xG-defying survivors, stood between Morecambe and automatic promotion.
24th minute: Amri, just 16 years old, burst between two centre-backs and fired low. 1-0. The place erupted.
But Carlisle hit back before half-time, punishing a defensive mix-up. 1-1. Nerves crept in.
71st minute: Free kick, right side. The ball whipped in. Muskwe rose highest, powered a header past the keeper. 2-1. The stands shook.
83rd minute: Agyemang, a midfielder pressed into service at wing-back, surged forward. Two defenders beaten. Shot driven low, far corner. 3-1.
The final whistle felt like an explosion.
Champions.
In the dressing room afterwards, Muskwe held court with 38 goals for the season. Buabo, back from injury, had 28. Together, they'd scored 66 - 62% of Morecambe's output.
MacDonald, exhausted but beaming, held the trophy aloft. Dixon and Williams danced. Azeez quietly packed his kit, smiling.
107 points. Champions by seven. From administration to automatic promotion in one season.
But Newton knew the hardest part was still ahead. League Two awaited. And this squad of loans and free agents wouldn't survive at that level - not without reinforcements.
The rescue mission was complete. The consolidation was about to begin.
