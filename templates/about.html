                        This series follows my journey with <strong>Morecambe FC</strong>, a club I found
                        in administration and on the brink of collapse. The challenge? Take them from
                        rock bottom to footballing success, one match at a time.

                        I write detailed narrative stories with tactical breakdowns, transfer sagas,
                        and the emotional rollercoaster that every FM player knows too well. Each article
                        covers a chunk of the save, capturing the key moments and turning points.

                        I'm currently managing <strong>Morecambe FC</strong>, taking them from the
                        lower leagues to (hopefully) Premier League glory. Follow along as we make
                        history!
